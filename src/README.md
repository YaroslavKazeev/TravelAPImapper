# src/

This folder contains all the source code for the TravelMapper application. It is the main directory for application logic, components, utilities, and views.

## Structure

- **app.js**: Entry point for the application logic.
- **map.js**: Handles map-related logic and interactions.
- **pages/**: Contains page-level components or scripts.
- **util/**: Utility functions and helpers used throughout the app.
- **views/**: UI components and view logic.

The `src` folder is organized to separate concerns between application logic, utilities, and UI components. Each subfolder has a specific responsibility, making the codebase modular and maintainable.
