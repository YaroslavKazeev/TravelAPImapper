# views/

This folder contains UI components and view logic for the application.

## Contents

- **dummyMapView.js**: Displays a dummy map view for mockup or testing purposes.
- **errorView.js**: Handles the display of error messages or error states.
- **mapView.js**: Main map display and interaction logic.
- **suggestionView.js**: Displays suggestions to the user based on input or API data.

UI components and view logic are kept here, separate from page-level scripts (`pages/`) and utility functions (`util/`). This modular approach makes it easier to manage and update the user interface independently of other application logic.
