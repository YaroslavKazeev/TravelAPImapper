# pages/

This folder contains scripts or components that represent full pages or major sections of the application.

## Contents

- **mainPage.js**: The main landing page or entry view for the application.

Page-level logic and layout are kept here, distinct from lower-level UI components (in `views/`) and utility functions (in `util/`). This helps maintain a clear structure between overall page composition and reusable components.
